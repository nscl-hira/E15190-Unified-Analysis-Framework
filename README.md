## Getting the code
### Using git
The latest version of the code can be obtained by using the git command. This is possible after installing git on a linux machine (see https://git-scm.com/download/linux for further documentation on how to install git). Use the following command to download the framework:
````
$ git clone https://github.com/nscl-hira/E15190-Unified-Analysis-Framework.git
````
### Downloading from Git Hub
The code can be downloaded also frm the Git Hub web page at the link: https://github.com/dellaquilamaster/HiRAEVT, by
clicking on the "Clone or Download" button on the right side of the page and then "Download ZIP". It is possible to donwload also a previous release of the code. For a complete list of all the releases please visit: https://github.com/nscl-hira/E15190-Unified-Analysis-Framework.git.
## Setup and Configuration
### Requirements
The code is compiled using the g++ compiler.
In order to compile and run the code ROOT 6 is required (the program has been tested with version 6.04.02). Please note that, since the program uses advanced ROOT 6 features, it is not possible to run or compile it by using an installation of ROOT 5. Ensure ROOT 6 environment variables are correctly exported. Usually one can use the command "source /mnt/misc/sw/x86_64/Debian/8/root/gnu/x.xx.xx/bin/thisroot.sh" or type it in the ".bash" file.
### Compile the code
To compile the code by using gcc compiler use the command:
````
$ make -jN
$ make install
````
where, in multi-cpu machines, N can be used to specify the number of core to use in the compilation and significantly speed up the procedure.
To proceed with a clean compilation run before the command:
````
$ make clean
````
or
````
$ make distclean
````
the latter will clear also shared libraries generated by the "install" option and stored in the directory "lib/".
### Configure the Program

### Limitations

## The E15190Reader Framework
### Framework Description
The framework allows to handle data of the E15190 experiment, with HiRAEVTMapper data structures, by including all the existing calibrations and detector analysis tools. The framework is fully versatile since it allows to include any possible combination of existing detectors in the analysis, and any possible combination of required calibrations. Calibrations are automatically retrieved from the corresponding files (usually located in the "calibration" sub-folder, as configured run-by-run in the "config/HiRAEVT.conf" file, and depending on the required combination of detectors). The framework includes 3 main features that are here summarized:  
a) Looping on previously existing raw data  
b) Building a new tree with calibrated data structures  
c) Looping on previously built calibrated data tree  
For a) and c) cases, the user should usually write his own main program following the examples, respectively, given by exec_LoopOnData.cpp and exec_LoopOnCalibratedData.cpp. The core of the main program is usually implemented as a method of the E15190Reader main class. One can use the example provided by the template methods E15190Reader::LoopOnData(const char \*, Long64_t) and E15190Reader::LoopOnCalibratedData(const char \*, Long64_t), located in E15190Reader.cpp, respectively for cases a) and c). It is convenient to store the implementation of additional methods by the user in the file E15190ReaderCustomized. This allows to more easier update the program to a future version, restoring all the customized methods already implemented by the user. The case b) is usually standard and a basic implementation is provided in the main program exec_BuildCalibratedData.cpp.
